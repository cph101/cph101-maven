## Hi there, and welcome to my maven repo!

Example: adding the "Chemistry Lab" mod as a dependency
```groovy
// This should be in your build.gradle file

repositories {
	maven {
		url = 'https://maven.cph101.com/releases'
	}
}

dependencies {
	modImplementation include("cph:chemistrylab:1.0.2") // Remember! This is for Minecraft 1.19.2
}
```
And you probably want this in your fabric.mod.json:
```json5
{
	"depends": {
		"chemistrylab": ">=1.0.2" // allow versions 1.0.2 and up
	},
	// etc.. note that comments like these won't work in standard json
}
```
